This project was created as the final project of the Udemy course "The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp" taught by Angela Yu from the London App Brewery.

This project uses React.js to mimic the design of Google Keeps App. One can add notes and delete them. The notes can also have a title and a body.

This first image shows how the keeper app looks on load.
